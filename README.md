# Foodbot

This is a Slack bot I built to help figure out where to go out to eat in New Haven. \
Restaurant data is pulled from the Zomato API. \
Has the ability to find restaurants based on type of cuisine. \
Users can create a list of "favorite" restaurants and have the bot choose one at random when they are feeling indecisive
